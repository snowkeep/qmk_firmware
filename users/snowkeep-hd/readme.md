# Hands Down keymap

This is a very slightly modified Hands Down Gold and Titanium, by [Alan
Reiser](https://sites.google.com/alanreiser.com/handsdown).  The layers are informed by
[Miryoku](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku) and topics linked from
[this](https://kbd.news/Caps-Word-and-other-QMK-tips-1073.html) Keyboard Builder's Digest article.

The code files split is based on replicaJunction's user area.
